## Experiments

### Data filtering, split and pre-processing
Run the following command before starting the experiments. This will apply filtering and cleaning to the raw data, create the data splits and generate the input used by each baseline model. 
```
make data
```
To change the data-processing workflow, go to [data](/data) and modify the utility scripts.

### Train the models
```
make train
```

### Generate evaluation table using pre-trained models
Decode each model and print the evaluation metrics summary table printed in the end using the Makefile.
```
make decode
```

Skip the decoding step and print the evaluation table from saved prediction results.
```
make gen_evaluation_table
```

Intermediate results generated by the decoding and evaluation steps will be printed. Set `verbose` to `False` in the following files to suppress those messages.
```
encoder_decoder/decode_tools.py
eval/eval_tools.py
```
