# Experiments

### Data filtering, split and pre-processing
```
make data
```
To modify the data-processing workflow, go to [data](/data).

### Train the models
```
make train
```

### Generate evaluation table using pre-trained models
Decode each model and print the evaluation metrics summary table printed in the end using the Makefile.
```
make decode
```

Skip the decoding step and print the evaluation table from saved prediction results.
```
make gen_evaluation_table
```

Intermediate results generated by the decoding and evaluation steps will be printed. Set `verbose` to `False` in the following files to suppress those messages.
```
encoder_decoder/decode_tools.py
eval/eval_tools.py
```
